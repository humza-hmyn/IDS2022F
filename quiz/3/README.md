1. Aesthetics in the realm of data visualization refers to the utility that the overall design and visual representation that the data is presented in. This is very important because
when it comes to presenting the data you have researched and compiled, it must be shown in such a way that is logical and easy-to-digest by the viewing party.

2. Two main forms of aesthetics in data visualization are: countinous and discrete. With the former, continous, it is referred to as 

3. Factors often are the the variables represented in data and factors are the values or information the factors carry. An example: Factor can be a pet and it can either be a dog or a cat;
hence it has 2 levels.

4. Data is left in two categories: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data is often the 'quantity' values, represented as numbers. Qualitative data is rather an expression of the data;
a description of "why" and "how" the data represented came to be. 

5. Another name for a variable containing data is a factor.

6. Ordered data is such that is organized in such a way that is independent that of the value of each item; such as a List. Unordered data is organized but the order is determined via the 
value of the data itself; such as a Set.

7. The X and Y axes in a coordinate system graph should be represented with same units and grid size.

8. If you have data that represents data that is non-linear, it would be better to represent it in a similar way; such that it isn't represented by linear bars but almost like a histogram
with respect to increasing maxims.

9. Data sets that can be best seen in polar coordinate based graphs are data that is beign compared over a time range, such as temperature values over a time period.

10. There are color scales that are used to represent a range of data values (Sequential), such as "Heat" and "Viridis," these color scales have a increasing shade or hue based on increasing data extremity.
There are also color scales used to represent a range of data values but include a divergent point (Diverging color scale), or a median in the data such as "CARTO Earth" and "Blue-Red."
There are situations where certain data values within in a range are needed to be highlighted and focused (accent scales), so color grids with striking and loud colors amongst the similar pallette are used
such as "Okabe Ito Accent" and "ColorBrewer Accent." Finally, there are color scales that are used with different hues/tones that represent qualitative data, such as "Okabe Ito" and "ggplot2 hue."

11. 3D plots in data science visualization are not ver effective in properly conveying the data to be presented because they often distort and obsecure the axes and graph elements needed
to be seen in order to fully actualize the information presented.

12. An example of a dataset that takes in categorical data would be a consumer survey that describes how a user feels about a product or a service. There is a limited range of options
that a user can choose to describe their experience.

13. Color is a qualitative value - it is non numerical.

14. The order is as follows, in terms of representing reality best: Winkel Triple, Robinson, and Cartesian.

15. The bottom left black graph is best for displaying data as well as the right red graph. Though the red one has slight distortion, it's distortion can be used to show data that is 
non-inear and skewed. 

16. The first palette is far better as it offers a stark difference in tones to represent two different maxims in data.

17. The answers are as follows: Chicago has least varying temperature through the year, Death Valley has wildest variation annually, San Diego is the hottest in January, San Diego is coolest in July.

18. A: Qualitative color scale B: Sequential color scale C: Diverging Color Scale D: Accent Color Scale

19. The Accent Color Scale has been used to represent this data

20. The range of the weekend gross values starts at such an exorbantly broad value that the lower grossing films' earnings are barely discernable

21. The Y axis for the graph that represents density has a range that needed to be better reduced to focus in on the actual values and it needs a unit (denity measured in what metric?)

22. The attached file has the graph and table.

23. In the following decades, the Earth's temperature will increase, especially given the past trends of the graph. The Earth will approximately be hotter bt 2 Celsius.
