1. The steps involved in scientific inference are as follows: by following the scientific method, we have observationhal data, model contruction and calibration, prediction, recording of natural phenomena,
and then loop back into the first step through completion for as many times necessary.

2. Data is information that is typically assorted as a facet of mathematical abstraction and is something that is quantifiable. Unlike data, reality is something that does not hold universal similarity but is
ultimately very unique in the regard that it is different for every individual. Though it should be noted that reality only has one means of being "universal" (for the lack of a beter term) and that is 
the idea that reality is something we all experience and it is the basis for our individual observations. Because of this, reality is the least and last considered item in the scientific model.

3. Model validation is the method that scientists compare the model of a system to a the actual observed system in order to gauge the accuracy and overall comprehensiveness of it. On the other hand, 
model calibration is the process of adjusting the model to fit into a certain criteria established by the observed system better.

4. The three pillars of science are as follows: Experiment, theory, and simulation.

5. Simulation is a very powerful means of expresssing and understanding data. This can be used to replicate an observed system to a high level of accuracy; such that scientists can almost completely model
the exact system and use it to predict what it would do given a set of circumstances. With this, simulations can enhace the quality and encourage the looping of the scientific method as new theories and 
simulated experiments can be done in the model. 

6. Two types of logical reasoning:
	I. Deductive Reasoning: By observing a system/variety of interconnected systems and the various concrete data that surounds such, one can make a conclusion that fits into the system based on the 
	rules set by the data seen in the system.
	Example: Exotic cars are very expensive. The Porsche 911 GT3 RS is an exotic car. Therefore, the Porsche 911 GT3 RS is expensive.

	II. Inductive Reasoning: In inductive reasoning, one observes a unique event or system and analyzes a pattern in it, such that the details in the system add up to a conclusion based on the activities 
	present in said system.
	Example: The Mercedes CLK GTR flipped in Le Mans 1998 and 1999. Mercedes is doing a test run in 2000. The CLK GTR may flip again this time.
7. Physical causation and logical implication are not always the same. Implication is something that exists in the realm of logic, something that is observed and rationalized in the eye of man; it is something 
that completely exists in the realm of our rules and logic; whereas phsical causation is the "real" reality that exists outside of our control - it is something that will never change via our understanding of
the universe or our subjectice realities. It will always remain constant.

8. Boolean algebra is named after George Bool.

11. If two propositions have the same truth values, then they are logiclly equivalent; such that if A is true and B is true, therefore A equals B.
