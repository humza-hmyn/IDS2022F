What is smallest unit of information in computers? (Hint: Recall our computer programming lecture)
	The byte is the smallest unit of information in computers
Why humans have chosen the binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computers?
	Binary information is in parallel conjumction wiohth the ONN/OFF states of electrical transistors
What is the typical speed of contemporary computer registers?
	IN realtion to the speed of the processors
What decade was the first digital computer built?
	The first digital computer ENIAC, was built in the 1950's.
What is a fixed program computer?
	This is a special program computer that is designed only for one funciom, as per defined by it's fixed/set program architecture,
Name an example of modern-day fixed program computer.
	Such an example would include a calculator as it can only do basic arihmatic operations.
What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?
	Imperative knowledge is in regards to knowledfge gained by performance of an task whereas declarative knowledge is is defined and complete - no longer needing expansion. 
What class of human knowledge algorithms belong to?
	Algorithms are a part of declarative knowledge
What is a computer bug?
	A computer bug is another name for a runtime error in whic a program does something that was unintended/performs in a way out of the programs intent.
What is a compiler? (Hint: Recall the glossary of our lectures)
	A compiler is a program that takes code written by a user and translates it into machine leve code for the computer to use and execute
What is the name of the first digital computer?
	ENIAC

	Python and R are both used extensively in bioinformatics
Name a computer programming language whose evolution and popularity is tightly coupled with the field of Numerical Computing, Atmospheric Science, Plasma Sciences, and Aerospace Engineering, among others.
	MATLAB 
Name the five major components of a modern digital computer.
	Input, Output Unit, Memory unit, Control unit, ALU
Name an example of fixed-program computer.
	A calculator is a fixed program computer
Order the following languages chronologically according to their birth date. (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes)
Java, COBOL, C++, Python, Fortran, B

OREDERED LIST: FORTRAN, COBOL, B, C++, Python, and Java.

(A) What is the closest programming language to machine code (i.e., binary code)?
	Assembly programming is the closet one can get to machine code.

(B) Does it need interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible?
	Assembly does not require an interpreter - it is directly read from in machine 
(A) Name the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use.
	FORTRAN is the oldes high level language still used today.
(B) Approximately how many decades is it old? (Â±15 years is acceptable answer. the decade it was created is also an acceptable answer)
	It is 68 years old
(A) Name a second-generation programming language.
	ASM x86 is an example of an 
(B) Which language-generation are Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, R?
	FORTRAN, C, and C++ are all third generation languages whereas Python and MATLAB are all fourth generation languages.
In what decades C, C++, and MATLAB/Python were created, respectively? (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes)
	C was made in the 70's, C++ was mad ein the mid 80's, MATLAB came about in the mid to late 80's and Python was born in the early 90's
Name an ancestor programming language of C (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).
	B is an ancestor of teh C programming language; both developed by Bell Labs.
Name a programming language ancestor of C++ (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).
	C++ comes from trh C programming language
Name a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and a programming language ancestor of Python (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).
	FORTRAN was what MATLAB was originally based around and also shares a parallel with Python in syntax. Python comes  from SETL, a language made and used for high level math modeling. 
How do you define logarithm? Explain with a simple example just as we did in class.
	If exponentiation is using an exponent to raise a number to a power, then logarithims are the inverse of that; such that they are used to define and find what power a base was raised to.
