1. The range of a probability value is defined between [0,1] (inclusive) or from [1,infinity +). This means that the range has the attribute of

2. In the case that both individuals are absolutely the same in their trusteworthiness only, then the deduction of what animal is in the distance
can be mostly left to various factors such the knowledge and eyesight of the person looking at the animal - but this disparity is inconclusive and
in the realm of logic, this would be best left to implicit intuition. It is far better to assume the animal sighted is a donkey as the figure of the
animal is small enough to fit into the realm of it being seen as a horse. Furthermore, the donley's stature can be related to one of that of a 
foal or a pony, as per the identification of horses go.
