IDS 2022F FINAL EXAM - HUMZA HUMAYUN

1. Model validation is when you are in the post-model training stage and are going over the model, making sure it is proper or 
appropriate for the given task. Calibration is setting up and creating the model, specifically finding the right parameters for it.

2. Aesthetic in the world of data visualization are in terms of how the model looks as well as the ways in which the models visual
tools are used to enhance understanding and engagement. Some tools would include color pallettes, charts/chart design, shape, size,
and line width.

3. The first bar, the gradient from red to green, is the best palette to communicate with humans with. We have this understanding
of the two colors, red and green, as both extremities of values (red = bad, green = good) and this gradient communicates the chart's 
overall range over such extrema.

4. a. Qualitative b. Sequential c. Diverging d. Accent

5. Three pillars of science: Experiment, Computation, and Experiemnt/Data

6. Logical implication is NOT the same as logical causality. EX: Birds can fly and chickens are birds: so they should be able to fly.
But chickens cannot fly like how Eagles do.

7. 
i.No, this data is hard to understand and it is too cramped where there is distortion in the numbers meant to be read on the left side.
ii. Aleatory uncertainty; because of the overall sparsity of the data as well as it's almost random range.
iii. POsitive correlation. 
iv. Yes. The model displays the data arranged in order of a repectively ordered timeframe and successively plots the points to the 
data in sequence of years passed.
v. 0.070925267

8. Bayesian

9. Frequentist

10. Frequenstst, as their methodolgy disallows prior knowledge and the degree of belief. Frequentis resort to trials and testing,
something that is very hard to quantify and perform in a situation like this. 

11. The zero on the X-axis is not centered at the origin, there cannot exist age before a persons' birth. (You cant be less than unborn)

12. Everthing in computers are represented by integers because of the underlying binary structure of computers. Binary is in a series
of 1's and 0's, both being integers. Binary can be thought of in the realm of logic gates, with "true" or "False" values (1 or 0's). 

13. C's origins and "ancestry" can be traced to the BCPL based language, B.

14. The first high level programming language in history was Fortran and is still used widely today.

15. Polar coordinates are best used to represent distance and angles, so one can use a polar coordinate plane to represent various
trajectories and spatial data. Best seen in airpanes on the radar screen, where the pilot is able to see other planes and marked 
hazards in relation to where his plane is in the sky - he can see and measure the angle of approach and distance to an area.
