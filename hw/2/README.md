1. What does ENIAC stand for?
	ENIAC stands for 'Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.' Built in 1945 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, it is noted as the first general-purpose computer.

2. Why is everything represented by integers in computers?
	Everything in computing is tied back to Binary code; which is represented in a series of ones and zeroes. Integer repesentation of data in computing architecture is efficiently represented via memory address or registers.

3. What is the name of the fastest part of the computer memory?
	The fastest part of a computers memory is the cache memory. Here, data is saved (often from previous work) that makes retrieval of the aforementioned data as well as those relative to it, faster and easier.

4. What is the slowest storage device in computers (that is typically integrated with computers)?
	The slowest storage device in computers is typically the Hard Disk Drive (HDD). 

5. What is the smallest unit of information in computer science?
	Bits are the smallest unit of data in computer science. They comprise all of every data set and structure. 

6. (A) What is the closest programming language to machine code (i.e., binary code)?
	Assembly code is the closest one can get before they enter the realm of ones and zeroes.
   (B) Does it need interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible?
	No, as Assembly is a machine level language, it run straightforward.

7. (A) Name the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use.
	FORTRAN ("the FORmula TRANslation) is a general purpose programming language that dates back to the late 1950's that is still used today.
(B) Approximately how many decades is it old? (±15 years is acceptable answer. the decade it was created is also an acceptable answer)
	FORTRAN is around sixty-five (65) years of age! It qualifies for a Senior discount!

9. (A) Name a second-generation programming language.
	A second-generation programmmin language is often a means of categorizing programming languages that work close with binary; such as assembly languages. Such an example includes x86 ASM.
(B) Which language-generation are Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, R?

10. In what decades C, C++, and MATLAB/Python were created, respectively?
	C and C++ were both made in the late 70's to early 80's; mostly residing in the early 80's with the advancement of object oriented workflows. MATLAB followed suit in the mid 80's as a matrix calculator rather as a modeling/programming suite
	as we know it today. Finally, Python was made in the early 90's as easy-to-read and powerful general use language.

11. Name an ancestor programming language of C.
	Ironically, an older ancestor of the C programming language was B; a programming language also developed by Bell Labs. One of the big differences between the two were that C was typed (in terms of variables) and B wasn't.

12. Name a programming language ancestor of C++.
	C++ comes from the programming language C. It was intriduced first as "C with Objects" as it was a version of C++ that could handle objects and clsses but then took name of C++. 

13. Name a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and a programming language ancestor of Python.
	The origins of MATLAB are somewhat vague, though it started out as a matrix calculator and has long evolved since then but many dictate that it was originally made with FORTRAN. Today the code resembles something that of Python but it's ineterpreter is based in Java.

14. What are the three common types of errors in computer programs? Provide an example for each category.
	I. Syntax Errors - Error in the program's code in which the script is written incorrectly as by the language's rules.
	II. Logic Errors - Errors in the program that is resultant from faulty logic, such that the program is not broken but behaving in a way not implied to be.
	III. Runtime Errors - Errors that take place in when the program is running, such as memory leaks (especially when working with precarious pointers in C)

15. Suppose you write a program that has memory leak. What type of programming error you dealing with?
	A memory leak is a type of runtime error. The erraneous code will compile but on runtimr will create a bug.

16. Extra credit: What are the three fundamental components of a Turing-complete language?
	I. Infinite Random Access Memory (RAM)
	II. Conditional Execution (If/Else/While)
	III. Repeated Execution 

17. Extra credit: How would you distinguish exponential behavior vs. power-law behavior (function) in a 2-dimensional plot?
Hint: Recall our discussion of the ENAIC project and the relative frequency of keywords such as “computer” in our programming.
	Exponential behavior has interesting tendancies towards its endpoints
