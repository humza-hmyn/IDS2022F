Homework No.3 Humza Humayun - DATA 1301 Shahmoradi - CDS2022F

1. The three pillars of science are as folows:
	I. Experiment 
	II. Theory
	III. Simulation

2. Three different applications of computational and data sciences:
	I. Artificial Intelligence is one of the products of computational-based sciences; it allows for relatively advanced, yet fairly human approach to workflows - the only differnce being that it can 
	model and surpass the human mind itself. Such an example would be the Artificial Intelligence software used in the new Google Pixel phone. This A.I can deduce the best possible means of improving
	a photograph via automatically editing and processing images on creation. Instead of the user having to spend time editing a photo, the A.I does it on its own and simplifies the process.

	II. Computational Sciences are commonly seen today in the lab environment in the form of Computational Biology. This is a field that is heavily based on the fundementals of genetics and microbiology
	as well as a strong base of data science. In Computational Biology, we often see the processing and high-volume assessment of genetic data, sometimes as DNA codons or peptide sequences. This is 	
	important as the sheer volume of data analyzed in this form of research is too much for a bare human team to work with, as a well composed algorithim and powerful hardware could perform the task with
	far greater efficiency. 

	III. Computational sciences are also used significantly in the field of astrophysics as the computations made based on data collected from space are in such volume and complexity that a person cannot
	reliably perform them. Not only is it the volume and difficulty of such data, it is also the way that the data is modeled to help us better understand how the far reaches of our galaxy really look
	like.

3. Two Types of Scientific Reasoning (as well as an example in argumentative defense):
	I. Deductive Reasoning:
		- Deductive reasoning is a form of thinking that consists of premises, an accepted fact, and a conclusion that is derived from the premise such that the conclusion follows the logic suggested
		by the premises refrenced.
		- Example: There are sharks in water. There is water in the swimming pool. Therefore, there are sharks in my pool!
	II. Inductive Reasoning:
		- Inductive reasoning is a form of thinking that is based on the observation of unique scenarios and the logic of recognizing patterns in such observed events. This means that by seeing a 
		specific event unfold, one can pay attention to the details in the event to create an idea of what occurring overall.
		- Example: The newest computer game requires at least an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card to run it. I saw my friend playing the new computer game. Therefore, my friend has at least that card.

4. In this situation, the policeman had used inductive reasoning to deduce that the man at the scene of the crime was the robber. This is because the officer has observed specific variables in this unique
situation and then arranged a subsequent patter from such data. The logic of the crime scene is as follows: "if the burglar alarm is going off, then a robbery is occurring right now; if the window of the 
jewelry store is broken and the alarm is going off, then it is fair to assume that tis just happened and the culprit is near; if there is a suspicious individual at the window with a bag full of items, then 
this has to be the culprit." All of these micro details add up to create a definite image of the scenario.
