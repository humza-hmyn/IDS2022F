IDS2022F QUIZ 1 - Humza Humayun

1. Created the subfolder system in the quiz directory

2. Whwn we create files with the wxtension '.md', we denote the file to utilize markdown language; 'md'directly meaning 'markdown.'
we prefer to use the this extension because we want to consciously use markdown language for our work as it is a powerful way to regulate text files.

3. Git software does not track or index empty files in our projects. We typically have to add a README or demo file to the empty folders/files 
as to entice Git to track them.

4. Yes, it must. After we ustilize the 'git init' command, we are left with a '.Git' file on our file directory. This folder has all necessaer information 
in order to use the Git sotftware for version control. 

5. The '.git. folder in our Git initialized local repository is a hidden file that allows the user to use Git's version control system. It 
contains the addresses to all repositories and remotes, as well as commit histories.

6. Use the 'git help' command to list all possible git commands.

7. The BASH command 'cd' opens a directory; it officially means "change directory."

8. The BASH command 'ls -a' allows all directories in a folder to be shown, especially those of which that are invisible. 

9. The BASH command 'pwd' allows the user to see their current place inside of a file system; mainly, the full name of the current working directory.

10. Three Fast-Growing Fields w/ Respect to Data Science: <br />
	i. Bioinformatics <br />
	ii. Financial Quantative Analyst <br />
	iii. Data Scientist  <br />

11. Different Areas of a Git Project: <br />
	i. Working Area <br />
	ii. Staging Area <br />
	iii. git Directory (The Repository <br />
12. A Version COntrol System (VCS) is a series of systems (be they harware and/or software) that are set to track, store, and provide changes 
in computer files and programs.

13. Four Modern Scientific Tools that Grew Exponentially Fast in the Last Decade: <br />
	i. Perl  <br />
	ii. Python <br />
	iii. Bioinformatics <br />
	iv. Data Analysis <br />

14. Six benefits of Using a Distributed VCS: <br />
	i. Every member of project has their own copy of the project <br />
	ii. If anything were to happen to the main server, every node/user has a backup of the original project <br />
	iii.Users can work without an internet connection as they have a local copy of the original project <br />
	iv: DVCS allow easier merging into repositories as well as a significantly less likely hood for branch merge conflicts <br />
	v: Technically speaking, each clone of the main repository is a backup of it <br />
	vi: DVCS's are also helpful in the fact they provide a way to organize work in a **distributed** manner - where teams can review and  <br />
	check code that is meant to be committed to the main repository.  <br />

15. 3 Historical Versions of VCS's <br />
	i. Local VCS <br />
	ii. Centralized VCS <br />
	ii. Distributed VCS <br />

16. Git is the software that is used to access a repositor whereas Githb is the actual repository that stores data. Git is the server client
and GitHub is the host.

17. 'git status' gives the user the current data on the git 

18. 'git push --all' is the final step in sending data to the GitHub repository. The '--all' suffix at the end denotes that all files in a 
the current working directory are pushed on to the server.

19. 'git pull' retrieves the current remote version of the project and downloads it into your local repository.

20.Three major pillars of Science: <br />
	i. Experiment <br />
	ii. Theory <br />
	iii. Computation/Data <br />


21. Three Major Applications of Computational + Data Sciences: <br />
	i. Predictive computing <br />
	ii. Numerical simulation <br />
	iii. Machine-learning (Data driven models) <br />

22. Markdown is a type of formatting syntax made for plain text documents. Markdown is almost universal, it 
has various commands to help with semantics and emphasis, and simplifies formatting.

23. Boldface in markdown is denoted by placing two asterisks (*) by the text intended to bold.

24. Like boldface text, italicized text in markdown is acheived via a single asterisk (*).

25. The git command 'git init' is used to instantiate a blank git repository on the local system.

26. The first digital computer was the ENIAC (U.S) in 1946.

27. ENIAC was built in 1946 - during the 1940's

28. The first digital computer was made in the United States, it was named ENIAC.

29. Three major components of Data Science: <br />
	i. Coding   <br />
	ii. Statistics  <br />
	iii. Domain <br />

30. A Data Scientist is a person who has the interdisciplinary knowlege of coding, mathematics/statistics, and a specialty domain (background) and uses these <br />
	competencies to work with data
