1. Aesthetics in data visualization refer to how all of the visual components work together to create a comprehensive and overall very effective means of conveying data - such that the audience can fully comprehend it
2. There are continous and discrete forms of aesthetics in data visualization
3. There is qualitative data and quantitative data. Qualitative data is descriptive information, detailing the properties of an item such as color and shape. Quantitative data is the numerical representation
or manifestation of data  - such as population, height, and amount.
4. Another name for data holding variables is factor.
5. Ordered data is such that is organized in such a way that is independent that of the value of each item; such as a List. Unordered data is organized but the order is determined via the value of the 
data itself; such as a Set.
6. Month and Location are: Qualitative/Categorical Day is: Quantitative/Numerical/Continous/Unordered Station ID: Quantitative/Categorical/Ordered Temperature: Quantitative/Numerical/Discrete/Ordered
7. The X and Y axes in a coordinate system graph should be represented with same units and grid size.
8. When data is varied over a range that cannot be measured exactly, it would be best to alter the axes of the coordinate plane in order to better represent the data.
9. Both the black and red graphs are valid but the blue one is too distorted to proprly display any data.
10. Temperature ranges of various cities over a year/time frame are best seen in a polar graph; one can see the various extrema in the temperature fluctuations according to the time and place.
11. 
	a: Sequential: Best to represent values that progressively get larger or change; such as temperature and statistics of market growth
	b: Diverging: Best to represent data that has a point in which the values reach a median/"meeting point" 
	c: Accent Scales: Best to show norms of data and variious bursts of extreme values in a region/data set
	d: Qualitative: Best shows varies data, often with not much relation to each other
12. The range of the Y-coordinate values that represent the gross (monetary) values produced by the films is such that the exact values made by the poor and medium performing movies is distorted.
13. 
14. The first palette works better as it connotates the positive and negative aspects of the colors red and green as well as providing distinction amongst two maxims.
